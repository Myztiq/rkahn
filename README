Proof of concept at the moment for a facebook photogallery loading service.

It will use a permanent OAuth token to auth with facebook. Then it will pull your personal phogotgalleries, making sure to only grab the public ones.
It will then loop through the photogallery photos and populate a mongoDB server. All future requests pull directly from the mongodb server to deliver super fast results.
The images are loading through facebooks CDN so you dont use any bandwith and things load super snappy.
